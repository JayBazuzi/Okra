# TODO
* report results with relative paths

- CMake
- Continuous Integration on VC++, clang, and gcc
- What should Assert look like?
- Organize tests by directory/file
- How to run just one file vs. all files
- Put functions in a namespace; product name on #defines
- clang-format
- special asserts for string equality, to avoid explicit casting?
